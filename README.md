### Purpose 

Generate a secure password to use for user accounts. 

### Functionality

Build a password generator application that allows the user to select a password length, if the user wants to use uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numeric characters, or smybol characters in their password. The user is able to generate a new password and copy the passwords to their clipboards.

### Re-Building 

This is what the old version of the application looked like from when I was in coding bootcamp. I decided to redo this application with a a better looking interface with more features.
